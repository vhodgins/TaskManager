# TaskManager
This is a fairly complex flask app that I have been using to teach myself the basics of web development. 
Core concepts that are used in the project include database management with sqlAlchemey, processing ajax 
requests, templating with jinja2, styling with css and bootstrap, as well as both back end and front end 
functionality using javascript and python. Altogether, theres hundreds of hours of my own time and experience
in this project.
